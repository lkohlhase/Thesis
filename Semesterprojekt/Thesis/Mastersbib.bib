   abstract = {This work introduces an efficient method for fully automatic temporal segmentation of human motion
               sequences and similar time series. The method relies on a neighborhood graph to partition a given
               data sequence into distinct activities and motion primitives according to self-similar structures
               given in that input sequence. In particular, the fast detection of repetitions within the discovered
               activity segments is a crucial problem of any motion processing pipeline directed at motion analysis
               and synthesis. The same similarity information in the neighborhood graph is further exploited to
               cluster these primitives into larger entities of semantic significance. The elements subject to this
               classification are then used as prior for estimating the same target values for entirely unknown
               streams of data.
               
               The technique makes no assumptions about the motion sequences at hand and no user interaction is
               required for the segmentation or clustering. Tests of our techniques are conducted on the CMU and
               HDM05 motion capture databases demonstrating the capability of our system handling motion
               segmentation, clustering, motion synthesis and transfer-of-label problems in practice - the latter
               being an optional step which relies on the preexistence of a small set of labeled data.}

abstract={A number of abrupt change detection methods have been proposed in the past, among which are efficient model-based techniques such as the Generalized Likelihood Ratio (GLR) test. We consider the case where no accurate nor tractable model can be found, using a model-free approach, called Kernel change detection (KCD). KCD compares two sets of descriptors extracted online from the signal at each time instant: The immediate past set and the immediate future set. Based on the soft margin single-class Support Vector Machine (SVM), we build a dissimilarity measure in feature space between those sets, without estimating densities as an intermediary step. This dissimilarity measure is shown to be asymptotically equivalent to the Fisher ratio in the Gaussian case. Implementation issues are addressed; in particular, the dissimilarity measure can be computed online in input space. Simulation results on both synthetic signals and real music signals show the efficiency of KCD.},

abstract={In recent years, there has been an explosion of interest in mining time-series databases. As with most computer science problems, representation of the data is the key to efficient and effective solutions. One of the most commonly used representations is piecewise linear approximation. This representation has been used by various researchers to support clustering, classification, indexing and association rule mining of time-series data. A variety of algorithms have been proposed to obtain this representation, with several algorithms having been independently rediscovered several times. In this paper, we undertake the first extensive review and empirical comparison of all proposed techniques. We show that all these algorithms have fatal flaws from a data-mining perspective. We introduce a novel algorithm that we empirically show to be superior to all others in the literature},

abstract={Temporal segmentation of human motion into actions is a crucial step for understanding and building computational models of human motion. Several issues contribute to the challenge of this task. These include the large variability in the temporal scale and periodicity of human actions, as well as the exponential nature of all possible movement combinations. We formulate the temporal segmentation problem as an extension of standard clustering algorithms. In particular, this paper proposes aligned cluster analysis (ACA), a robust method to temporally segment streams of motion capture data into actions. ACA extends standard kernel k-means clustering in two ways: (1) the cluster means contain a variable number of features, and (2) a dynamic time warping (DTW) kernel is used to achieve temporal invariance. Experimental results, reported on synthetic data and the Carnegie Mellon Motion Capture database, demonstrate its effectiveness.},

abstract={We propose methods for segmenting a motion sequence into motion primitives, taking into account temporal constraints (continuity along the time axis). In the proposed methods, dynamic programming (DP) is used on a motion feature sequence to allow for the effects of these constraints on the results of the segmentation. The methods do not require such a running window along the time axis, as is typical for the usual methods, and thus they can be applied to the segmentation of transient motions. The results of comparative experiments using several motion features and segmentation methods on weightlifting motion data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

A compact motion representation is obtained for each segment using parameters of a damped harmonic dynamic model.

abstract={The analysis of human action captured in video sequences has been a topic of considerable interest in computer vision. Much of the previous work has focused on the problem of action or activity recognition, but ignored the problem of detecting action boundaries in a video sequence containing unfamiliar and arbitrary visual actions. This paper presents an approach to this problem based on detecting temporal discontinuities of the spatial pattern of image motion that captures the action. We represent frame to frame optical-flow in terms of the coefficients of the most significant principal components computed from all the flow-fields within a given video sequence. We then detect the discontinuities in the temporal trajectories of these coefficients based on three different measures. We compare our segment boundaries against those detected by human observers on the same sequences in a recent independent psychological study of human perception of visual events. We show experimental results on the two sequences that were used in this study. Our experimental results are promising both from visual evaluation and when compared against the results of the psychological study},

abstract={Real-world action recognition applications require the development of systems which are fast, can handle a large variety of actions without a priori knowledge of the type of actions, need a minimal number of parameters, and necessitate as short as possible learning stage. In this paper, we suggest such an approach. We regard dynamic activities as long-term temporal objects, which are characterized by spatio-temporal features at multiple temporal scales. Based on this, we design a simple statistical distance measure between video sequences which captures the similarities in their behavioral content. This measure is nonparametric and can thus handle a wide range of complex dynamic actions. Having a behavior-based distance measure between sequences, we use it for a variety of tasks, including: video indexing, temporal segmentation, and action-based video clustering. These tasks are performed without prior knowledge of the types of actions, their models, or their temporal extents},

abstract={Temporal segmentation of facial gestures in spontaneous facial behavior recorded in real-world settings is an important, unsolved, and relatively unexplored problem in facial image analysis. Several issues contribute to the challenge of this task. These include non-frontal pose, moderate to large out-of-plane head motion, large variability in the temporal scale of facial gestures, and the exponential nature of possible facial action combinations. To address these challenges, we propose a two-step approach to temporally segment facial behavior. The first step uses spectral graph techniques to cluster shape and appearance features invariant to some geometric transformations. The second step groups the clusters into temporally coherent facial gestures. We evaluated this method in facial behavior recorded during face-to- face interactions. The video data were originally collected to answer substantive questions in psychology without concern for algorithm development. The method achieved moderate convergent validity with manual FACS (Facial Action Coding System) annotation. Further, when used to preprocess video for manual FACS annotation, the method significantly improves productivity, thus addressing the need for ground-truth data for facial image analysis. Moreover, we were also able to detect unusual facial behavior.},
