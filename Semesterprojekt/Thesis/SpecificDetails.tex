\section{Specific Details}
The three methods presented here go in order from how online they are. We start with the full batch approach, which takes all the data that needs to be segmented at once.
\subsection{Full Batch}
\subsubsection{Finding Boundaries}
Enchanced k-means cluster, just find the cneters LULERINO KAPPUCINO. 
\subsection{Mini Batch}
Take fixed window sizes, find one boundary, work from there. 
\subsection{Full Online}
Essentially minibatch, but happy once a certain quality is reached.
\subsection{Parameters}
Reducenumber, number of features used. Delta and amount of features used for distance matrix. Distance measure (dtw versus just standard versus lazy as fuck :D )
