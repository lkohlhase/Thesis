\section{Results}
Compare with results from other papers. 
\ednote{First we want the direct comparisons, then just SFA as preprocessing for other methods, then potentially without any SFA at all}
\subsection{Toydata}
\subsection{Real data}
We use CMU motion capture data set.
\subsection{SFA as preprocessing}
\subsection{Selfsimilarity with no SFA}
